codeQuiz is a simple timed quiz that gives users 60 seconds to answer 10 JavaScript related questions.

For every question the user gets wrong, 10 seconds are subtracted from their remainig time.

If the user completes all 10 questions, the time remaining is their score.

If successful, the user is prompted to save their score by entering their name. Their saves scores are then displayed at the bottom of the page.

If the user is unsuccessful, their score would be 0 so they are not prompted to save it. They are prompted to try again.
